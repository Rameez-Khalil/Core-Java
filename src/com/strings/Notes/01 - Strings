String pool is a separate memory. This constantly checks whether or not the same content have different vars.

String name = "Rameez"
String name1 = "Rameez"

The above can be seen as two variables, but they are pointing to the same memory location, change in one var will result
creation of new object in memory. Therefore strings are immutable, because every time we are making a change,
we are not changing the actual content, instead we are creating new a object.


IMMUTABILITY:
    String x1 = "x1";
    String x2 = x1;
    String x3 = x2;

    If we are making a change in x1, that change won't get reflected in x2 and x3. This is known as immutability.
