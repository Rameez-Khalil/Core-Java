Programmers do face Syntax and Logical errors.
Users face runtime exceptions and these are known to be as Exceptions.


Runtime Errors:
    Runtime errors are generally caused at the user's end, and usually occur when there is a require resource
    is missing.
    E.g. We cannot expect the printer to execute properly with no pages being available to be used.

    We as a programmer will write best program to run in all possible scenarios except for these cases.
    The cases should be handled with the help of exception handling.
