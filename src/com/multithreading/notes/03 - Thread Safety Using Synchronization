1. When two threads are working/accessing the same data at the same time.
2. Synchronization of data can help us handling this situation.


3. What happens if two threads are accessing the same system?
PROCESSOR WORKING UNDER THREAD:
    At any given point in time, the processor can give control to any one thread.
    This can be a problem, if one thread is reading the data and one is waiting.

    Value = value + 1.
    Here we are reading the data from value and then incrementing it by 1.
    Suppose if two threads are working in parallel, t1 reads the value as 0 and assigns it as 1.
    The control then shifted towards t2, when t2 came in the value was 1 instead of 0.
    THIS IS THE ISSUE - DATA INCONSISTENCY.

ATOMICITY: Complete all or nothing - Synchronized keyword.
    synchronized(this){
    value = value +1;
    return value;
    }

    OR public synchronized int getNext(){
        value = value+1;
        return value;
    }
