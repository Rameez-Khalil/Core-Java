Create two classes Producer and Consumer.
Producer is going to be a thread therefore both implements Runnable.

This pattern facilitates these two tasks to run properly.
Cook - Producer.
Server - Consumer.
They both share the resource(order shelf).
Cook will wait if the order shelf is full.
Server will wait if the order is under process.

APPLICATION:
    We will be reading questions from user.
    We will then be answering those questions.
