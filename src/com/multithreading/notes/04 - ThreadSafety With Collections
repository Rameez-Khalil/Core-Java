With the help of synchronization we put a lock.

Suppose we have a list where one thread is writing and one is reading.
ConcurrentModificationException.


PROJECT:
1. Product purchase list.
2. Product sold list.

ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap are not threadsafe.
This means if one thread is reading then the other cannot write.
This issue can be solved via join method.
We cannot use multithreading with arraylist, we need to make sure our data is synched.


This can be solved using concurrentCollection, these were meant to be thread safe.
