1. When we are using our computer, we are using multiple applications at the same time.
2. These applications are known as processes.
3. Inside these applications, there may be child processes.


CHROME EXAMPLE:
    Multiple tabs are acting as a child processes.
    These child processes are known as threads.



MULTI-THREADING:
    Multiple processes/threads/lines of codes can be executed at the same time.
    Each process will have its own execution.



THREAD EXECUTION / DEADLOCKS:
    1. When one threads is dependent on another to start exection.
    2. OUR THREAD CLASS WILL EXTEND JAVA THREAD CLASS WHICH IMPLEMENTS RUNNABLE INTERFACE
        THIS RUNNABLE INTERFACE HAS AN ABSTRACT run METHOD, WHICH WE NEED TO OVERRIDE.



THREAD START:
    1. Its not legal to start the thread more than once.
    2. If one instance/object is calling the the method (start) then the same cannot call
    this method, however, this can be achieved by creating a new instance.
