SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY:
        Each class should have one single purpose, and shouldn't be involved
        in unnecessary things.

EXAMPLE
    Suppose we have an Employee class and there is a functionality
    of isPromotionDue needs to be added.
    Instead of adding this functionality inside of an Employee class,
    we will add another class and embed this functionality into that.

    class Emp{
        // code.
    }
    class Promotion{
        public bool promotion(Emp emp){
            //code logic
        }
    }
