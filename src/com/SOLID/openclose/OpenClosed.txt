OPEN CLOSED:
        Classes should be opened for extension, but
        closed for modifications.

OPEN
    A class is considered to be open if its functionality
    can be enhanced by its subclasses.

CLOSED
     A class is considered to be closed if changes
     are guaranteed to not happen.



Suppose we are trying we've different shapes, and we are trying to calculate areas for each shape provided, one way to do it would be to create a class which contains methods calculateCir, calculateRect etc. This is not a good approach, as whenever there is a new requirement, we will have to create a class for the requirement and we then will need to make changes to the code base as well.
    Therfore, we are violating Open Closed principle,
    as we are modifying the class.



Create an interface, which will contain calculateArea.
Ever other class will have to implement this interface.
