BITWISE INTRODUCTION:

    These are generally faster than the general operators.
    AND & (if both bits are 1 then and only then it will result will be 1).
    OR | (if either of the provided values is 1 then it will be 1).
    NOT ~
    XOR ^ (When one of them is 1 then it will be 1).
    RIGHT SHIFT >>
    UNSIGNED RIGHT SHIFT >>>
    LEFT SHIFT <<


AND OPERATION:
     x = 10 and y  = 6; x & y = 2.

OR Operation:
    x = 10 and y = 6; x|y =
