INNER CLASS:
    A class within another class.
    When we are trying to reduce the complexity of class.
    An interface can also be defined under the class.


NESTED INNER CLASS:
    An inner class is also a member of the parent class.
    Outer class members are accessible within inner class.
    Outer class can access inner class members via object.
    Directly using inner class is of no use until/unless you have an object
    of outer class.

    Outer.Inner objectVar = new Outer().new Inner();
    Outer$inner.class will be generated.
