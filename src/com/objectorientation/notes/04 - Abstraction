ABSTRACTION:
    Abstraction is all about hiding the implementation.
    If we are driving the motorbike then we don't care about how the accelerator is working.

    This can be achieved via abstract class /interface.

    1. A method without body is an abstract method.
    2. Only abstract class can hold an abstract method.
    3. Abstract methods are meant to be overriden.
    4. Concrete (normal) methods are allowed.
