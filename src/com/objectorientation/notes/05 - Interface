INTERFACE:
    Interface is a blue print of the class.
    This defines what a class must do.
    This helps us to achieve abstraction and loose-coupling.

    1. Prior to java 8, only abstract methods were allowed, but now default, private and static methods
    are allowed.
    2. Constant fields are allowed, even if you don't define it final, by default its final
    3. Cannot create an object, a class has to implement it.
