INHERITANCE:
    1. Inheritance is about deriving the props. from the corresponding parent and grandparents(if any).
    2. This creates a blood relationship b/w classes.


ADVANTAGES:
    1. Code Re-usability.
    2. Polymorphism.

DISADVANTAGES:
    1. Tightly coupled.
    2. Change in parent affects its children.


TYPES OF INHERITANCE:
    1. Single Level - B is mapping the pros from A.
    2. Multi-level - C is mapping from B, and B is mapping from A.
    3. Multiple  - Not Supported in Java (Ambiguity error).
    4. Hybrid - (Multiple + Hierarchical) Not Supported in Java (Diamond problem).
    5. Hierarchical.



AMBIGUITY / DIAMOND ERROR:
    Suppose C class is extending A and B.
    A and B shares a method with same signature
    When calling that method from C class, it will get confused.


TYPES OF RELATIONSHIP:
    HAS-A: Association - > i) Aggregation: Weak bonding ii) Composition: Strong bonding.
    IS-A: Inheritance.
