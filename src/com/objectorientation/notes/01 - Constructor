Constructors are those functions that have the same name as that of their class names
They don't have any return type.
Access Modifiers are allowed - public, protected, private and default.

1. DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR:
    Compiler creates it.

2. No-ARG:
    We create our own default constructor.
    This becomes the default constructor.

3. Parameterized:
    Constructor accepting arguments to be initialized.
