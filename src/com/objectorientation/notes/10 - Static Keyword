STATIC KEYWORD:
    This is a non access modifier.
    Class level variables.
    Cannot be used with local variable
    Can be attached to:
        1. Variables.
        2. Methods.
        3. Block.
        4. Nested Class.



STATIC VARIABLE:
    Any variable having access modifiers of static.
        static int a = 20;
    The reason for creating static var is because of memory efficiency.
    As long as all the objects are sharing a constant value, we should make
    that field as static.


STATIC METHOD:

    Any method having static mentioned before it becomes a static method.
    Static methods belong to the class
    Can be called using dot notation.
    ClassName.methodName();
    They are memory efficient.

    CONSTRAINTS OF STATIC METHOD:
        1. Static methods belongs to the class, and not to the object.
        2. Static method can be accessed directly by class name.
        3. Static methods can access only static data. It cannot access non-static data.
        4. Static methods can call only other static methods and cannot call a non static method.
        5. Static methods cannot refer to this or super keyword.

STATIC BLOCK:
    A block of code having static keyword before it.
    Static block executes automatically when the class is loaded in the memory.

    Static block is used to load the native methods (code written in other language).
    static block is used to initialize the static vars.
