SINGLETON CLASS
    1. A class which can create one object, and multiple objects aren't allowed.
    2. Private constructor, therefore we cannot create an object
    3. Static methods are used to create an instance.


    Suppose we want to create an object of a coffee machine.
        - private variables.
        - private constructors.
        - static method to return the reference.
